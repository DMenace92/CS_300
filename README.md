•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that we are trying to solve is finding that proper algorithm use case for managing data that will be quick and efficient. taking the Know course corriculum and manageing through a sorting process to obtain the required information that is needed.

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Learning about data structures this term was very interesting. Though it was difficult to understand. the methods I used to solve my problems during this course is by googling and watching code along videos.  Working on the previous assignments I do see the benefit of the different sorting algorism have. As technology is advancing the amount of date is growing twice as much. Having algorithms that will manage the data is crustal for the speed and reliability of the program. 

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

There were many obstacles that I had regarding the final projects. Being new to the programming language it’s only natural and should not be hard on myself. To solve the problem, I first need to have a calm mind.  

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

working on this project I have first built the basic functions to start out the process. for example, I have built the four functions the main that will hold the menu, the input csv data function, print csv data and last search function. After I completed that I start implementing the heavy work. For this project I have implemented linked list. I have found that taking a big project and splice it to small chunks help with the coding process.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on the final project implementing vectors along with link list gave me a better understanding on how data is passed between different functions and class within the program. Another good progress I have developed through the course is researching and reading documentation in regard to the functionality of the method used in the program. Learning the process of building algorithms to manage data has been a real challenge for a fresh mind but the implementation is very crucial for the speed and effectiveness of the program’s functionality and usability.
